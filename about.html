        <h1>About TeenzUP</h1>
        <p>TeenzUP is an online platform built to empower teenagers and young adults with tools, opportunities, and guidance to succeed in today’s world. We create a bridge between student talent and real business needs—so students can learn by doing and businesses can access fresh ideas.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To help Bulgarian students discover and develop their talents by giving them access to meaningful, interest-based work. We support young people with a safe, structured path toward real experience, confidence, and first earnings.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>To become Bulgaria’s leading early-career platform that inspires and supports the next generation of professionals—by turning interests into practical experience and real results.</p>

        <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
        <p>Many students finish school with strong theory, but:</p>
        <ul style="color: var(--muted); margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <li>Lack meaningful experience: available jobs are often seasonal, low-skilled, and unrelated to their interests.</li>
          <li>Face a gap between school and business: students don’t have an easy way to connect with companies that would give them a real chance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Do (Our Solution)</h2>
        <p>TeenzUP is designed like an ecosystem that supports students in their first professional steps:</p>
        <ul style="color: var(--muted); margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <li><strong style="color: var(--text);">Interest-based project marketplace:</strong> companies post short, paid projects categorized by fields (digital marketing, graphic design, content creation, tech, social causes, and more).</li>
          <li><strong style="color: var(--text);">Profiles built on skills & talent:</strong> students create a profile and portfolio showing what they can do—even without official work experience.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: var(--text);">Ratings & feedback system:</strong> after each project, both sides leave a review to build reputation, accountability, and quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <ul class="values-list">
          <li class="value-item"><strong>Opportunity with purpose</strong> – meaningful work, not “just a job”</li>
          <li class="value-item"><strong>Growth & creativity</strong> – skill-building through real challenges</li>
          <li class="value-item"><strong>Inclusion & community</strong> – a space where every teen can thrive</li>
          <li class="value-item"><strong>Trust & responsibility</strong> – transparency through feedback and clear expectations</li>
        </ul>
